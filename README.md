# IMG 2 B64
Converts images from a URL into embeddable, copy-and-paste-able, text by encoding them in [Base64](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Base64).
Browsers can natively convert this format back into an image. Try pasting the results into your URL bar to see the image in your browser.

## Use B64 in HTML
Use the image in an HTML page by putting it in an `<img>` tag. 
```
<img src="[Paste Your Base64 Encoded Text Here]" alt="image description" />
```
